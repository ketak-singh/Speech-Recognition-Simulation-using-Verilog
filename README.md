# Speech-Recognition-Simulation-using-Verilog
Our project aimed at developing a Real-Time Speech Recognition Engine on an FPGA using Altera DE2 board. The system was designed so as to recognize the word being spoken into the microphone. As large number of accents spoken around the world that this conundrum still remains an active area of research. Speech Recognition finds numerous applications including health care, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, Interactive Voice Response Systems, military, avionics, etc. Another most important application resides in helping physically-challenged people to interact with the world in a better way.
